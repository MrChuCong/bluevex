This document lists features and ideas to be implemented in future versions.


# Features #

  * Collision map data accessable from managed plugins
  * Auto teleport and navigation systems
  * A generic bot system
  * Auto login and game creation to be handled in the bluevex core so plugin developers dont need access to sensitive data.
